# Overview

My Medium blogs will be a way to communicate my findings and thoughts. This will be a great way to retain information and document my projects. 

I have decided to split my blogs in a series format with each having common themes. This will allow me to organize my thoughts more effectively, where I will be forced to formalize my findings.

In the past, I created too many repos for my projects.

With that said, I hope you enjoy the blogs as much as I did writing them

Sometimes I dabble into philosophy themes if you're interested. The writing is more subjective in nature. 

These are a few I enjoyed writing :)
